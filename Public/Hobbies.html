    <h1>MY HOBBIES</h1> 
    <P>Life can be so much boring without extracurricular activities. below are my hobbies</P>
    <h2>Watching Movies</h2>
    <p>I am a person who loves anything in video and movies at a point almost became an addiction 
    to me to the extend of affecting my career like not meeting up to clients deadline. 
    But the good news is that when i became more close to Jesus Christ i was able to channel 
    my love for movies to watching only Christian movies.</p>
    <h2>Philosophy Discussion</h2>
    <p>As someone that loves critical thinking, Philosophy delibrations is something 
    i do at any given opportunity, most of my unconventional education comes from Philosophical discussions.</p>
    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>Growing up i realized i have a very strong creative mind and needed ways to express them and then i started hanging around music studio
    with my friends watching them as they write songs and head to the voicing room to produce music and then at a point i got involved in it so
    deep that i started writign my own songs and making some records that i almost took it as a career before this and that happened.
